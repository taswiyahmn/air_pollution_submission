Air pollution clustering and classification (Kmeans, KNN and decision tree)

In this submission, I applied **two stages of modeling**. The first stage uses a K-Means clustering technique to cluster the dataset and obtain cluster labels based on pollution patterns. The second stage is **classification**, where the clustering results are used as additional features in the prediction process. For the classification stage, I applied **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree** to categorize countries based on pollution levels.  

The final result of this modeling divides countries into three main categories based on pollution levels, namely **"High Pollution Country ‘**, **’Moderate Pollution Country ‘**, and **’Low Pollution Country ”**.
